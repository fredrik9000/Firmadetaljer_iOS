# Firmadetaljer

This is an iOS application written in Swift where you can search for information about Norwegian companies. The search is done against the Brønnøysundsregistrene API: https://wiki.brreg.no/display/DBNPUB/API

#### The app has the following features:

- Search for companies by name
- Search for companies by organization number
- View company details
- Navigate to parent company details (for those that have parent companies)
- Navigate to the company homepage
- Viewed companies are persisted and shown in its own list when not searching
- Option for clearing search history (meaning the persisted companies will be deleted)
- Dark mode support
- The app supports English and Norwegian languages

I have also made an Android version: [Android Firmadetaljer](https://github.com/fredrik9000/Firmadetaljer_Android)
